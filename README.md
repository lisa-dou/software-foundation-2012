========================
This repo contains my exercises of  "Software Foundations" course (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/). I will update the latest exercises when i finish. 
The course develops basic concepts of functional programming, logic, operational semantics, lambda-calculus, and static type systems, using the Coq proof assistant.
